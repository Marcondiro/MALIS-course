# Lab 2: Gradient Descent and The Perceptron

In this lab session, you will gain practical knowledge on gradient descent and the perceptron algorithm.

The lab is divided into two parts:

1. [Part 1: Solving Logistic Regression](./lr/log_reg_solver.ipynb)
2. [Part 2: The Perceptron](./perceptron/perceptron.ipynb)

### Learning goals

After this lab, you should be able to:

1. Have a clear understanding of gradient descent, how it works and how it is implemented
2. Have a deep understanding of the perceptron, its learning algorithm and its limitations
